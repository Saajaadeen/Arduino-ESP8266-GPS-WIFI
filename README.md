<center><h1>ESP8266 + BN-220 GPS Tracker</h1></center>

This ESP8266 can be used to build a compact GPS logger that tracks location data (LAT/LONG) as well as timestamps in any specified intervals.

<center><h1>Hardware</h1></center>

All the hardware being used in this project is a [Hiletgo ESP8266](https://a.co/d/daYSCQz) and a [Beitian BN-220](https://a.co/d/0MroIBl) attached to a breadboard not much else is needed to get the functionality though if you want to add a beeper and some other LED's to indicate certain sections of code or functions you can add those with the rest of the availble pins.
